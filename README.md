## About

This is an implementation of the libp2p [content routing interface](https://libp2p.github.io/js-libp2p-interfaces/interfaces/_libp2p_interface_content_routing.ContentRouting.html) that uses an [IPNI](https://github.com/ipni/specs) HTTP endpoint.

An alternative is [HTTP Routing V1](https://github.com/libp2p/js-reframe-content-routing) (previously known as Reframe) but the advantage of IPNI at least as of 2023-05-19 is that it returns results in a streaming fashion which can be faster.  Note that this will change with the rollout of [IPIP-410](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/410), at which point one can use the HTTP Routing V1 interface/implementation directly.

## Install

```console
$ npm i @libp2p/ipni-content-routing
```

### Browser `<script>` tag

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@libp2p/ipni-content-routing/dist/index.min.js"></script>
```

## Example

```js
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { ipniContentRouting } from '@libp2p/ipni-content-routing'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  contentRouters: [
    ipniContentRouting('https://cid.contact')
  ]
  //.. other config
})
await node.start()

for await (const provider of node.contentRouting.findProviders('cid')) {
  console.log('provider', provider)
}
```
